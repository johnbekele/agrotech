## Project Objective

Modern farmers face significant costs acquiring and maintaining agricultural machinery. Many small or medium farms cannot afford these machines, while others have underutilized equipment.

**AgroTech** is a web application that enables farmers to list, share, and rent agricultural equipment, reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and promoting sustainable resource use.

## Features

- **Secure Registration & Login:** Email verification via Nodemailer.
- **Tool Listings:** Add, edit, or remove equipment for rent.
- **Search & Rent:** Search tools with filters by location/type.
- **Booking Management:** Book, view, and cancel rentals.
- **Role-based Access:** Farmer and Admin roles.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage users and tool listings.
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile and desktop compatibility with Tailwind CSS.
